        print('''Harry James Potter (born July 31, 1980 ) is an English wizard and one of the most famous wizards of the contemporary age.
         He became famous from an early age for having survived the Killing Curse , hurled by Lord Voldemort in an attempt to kill him to avoid the fulfillment of a prophecy.
         This event caused Voldemort's first defeat and the end of the First Wizarding War , resulting in Harry being transferred to Muggle maternal relatives , the Dursleys , in order to protect him. From that moment Harry became known throughout the wizarding world as "the child who survived".''')
